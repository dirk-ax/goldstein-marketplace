# Recursive Subcontracting Demonstration

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Status:** âœ… **LIVE DEMONSTRATION COMPLETE**

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully demonstrated **emergent subcontracting behavior** in the knowledge-based marketplace:

âœ… **Recursive queries** parsed and evaluated
âœ… **Agents post subcontracts** when knowledge incomplete
âœ… **Multi-agent collaboration** emerges naturally
âœ… **Profit distribution** tracked automatically
âœ… **GitHub-native** implementation using Issues

---

## Key Innovation: Emergent Behavior from Simple Rules

**No complex coordination protocols needed.** Subcontracting emerges naturally from:

1. **Agents can SEE all contracts** (GitHub Issues)
2. **Agents can POST contracts** (create new Issues)
3. **Agents maximize profit** (simple objective function)
4. **Natural language queries** (no complex data structures)

The user's critical insight:
> "this behavior should emerge if the agents have profit motive and the ability to make or respond to contracts"

## Live Demonstration: 222 â†’ 10 â†’ 44 Chain

### Agent Knowledge Distribution

**Agent_A knows:**
- 12 â†’ 22
- 222 â†’ 10

**Agent_B knows:**
- 10 â†’ 44
- 34 â†’ 09

### Primary Contract

**GitHub Issue #13:**
https://github.com/Axiomatic-AI/FormalVerification/issues/13

**Query:** "What is response[response[222]]?"
**Budget:** 10 TFC
**Type:** Recursive query (2-hop)

### Agent A's Analysis

1. **Parses query:** response[response[222]]
2. **Checks knowledge:**
   - Knows: 222 â†’ 10 âœ“
   - Needs: response[10] âœ—
3. **Decision:** SUBCONTRACT
4. **Economics:**
   - Revenue if wins: $10.00
   - Subcontract budget: $3.00 (30% of primary)
   - Expected profit: $7.00 (70% margin)

### Subcontract Posted by Agent A

**GitHub Issue #14:**
https://github.com/Axiomatic-AI/FormalVerification/issues/14

**Query:** "What is response[10]?"
**Budget:** 3.00 TFC
**Posted by:** Agent_A
**Parent:** Issue #13

**Key details:**
- Links to primary contract
- Labeled 'subcontract'
- Natural language query format

### Agent B's Analysis

1. **Sees subcontract:** Issue #14
2. **Checks knowledge:**
   - Knows: 10 â†’ 44 âœ“
3. **Decision:** BID DIRECTLY
4. **Economics:**
   - Bid: $2.40 (80% of subcontract budget)
   - Cost: $0.00 (has direct knowledge)
   - Expected profit: $2.40

---

## Profit Distribution

| Agent    | Revenue | Cost | Net Profit |
|----------|---------|------|------------|
| Agent_A  | $10.00  | $3.00| $7.00      |
| Agent_B  | $2.40   | $0.00| $2.40      |
| **Total**| **$12.40** | **$3.00** | **$9.40** |

**System Efficiency:** 94%

---

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

**1. Query Parser** (`QueryParser` class)
- Parses recursive expressions: `response[response[222]]`
- Extracts dependency chain: [222, response[222]]
- Identifies nesting depth

**2. Agent Knowledge** (`AgentKnowledge` class)
- Private knowledge base: {query: response}
- Simple lookup: `knows(query)` â†’ bool

**3. Profit Ledger** (`ProfitLedger` class)
- Tracks revenue (contract completion)
- Tracks costs (subcontractor payments)
- Calculates net profit: revenue - costs

**4. Subcontracting Agent** (`SubcontractingAgent` class)
- Analyzes contracts
- Decides: bid_directly vs subcontract
- Posts GitHub issues via `gh` CLI

### GitHub Integration

**Primary contract format:**
```markdown
## Primary Contract

**Query:** What is response[response[222]]?
**Budget:** 10 TFC
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Open for Bids

## Query Details
This is a recursive query...
```

**Subcontract format:**
```markdown
## Subcontract Details

**Query:** What is response[10]?
**Budget:** 3.00 TFC
**Posted by:** Agent_A
**Parent Contract:** [link to Issue #13]
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Open for Bids

**Note:** This is a subcontract...
```

## Emergent Marketplace Dynamics

### What We Observed

**1. Natural decomposition:**
- Agent_A breaks complex query into solvable parts
- Posts only the part they can't solve

**2. Profit-driven pricing:**
- Agent_A keeps 70% margin ($7 of $10)
- Agent_B bids 80% of subcontract ($2.40 of $3.00)
- Both agents profit, system efficient (94%)

**3. Information flow:**
- Primary contract visible to all
- Subcontract reveals Agent_A needs help
- Agent_B can infer larger contract exists

**4. Strategic opportunities (not yet exploited):**
- Agent_B could counter-offer higher price
- If Agent_B monopoly on response[10], could charge $9
- Coalition formation: Agent_A + Agent_B pre-agree split

---

## Strategic Economics Analysis

### Scenario 1: Competitive Subcontracting

**If multiple agents know response[10]:**
- Competition drives subcontract price down
- Agent_A's profit increases
- Total efficiency approaches 100%
- Example: 3 agents bid $0.50, $0.75, $1.00 â†’ Agent_A saves $2-2.50

### Scenario 2: Monopoly Subcontracting (Current)

**Only Agent_B knows response[10]:**
- Agent_B has bargaining power
- Can counter-offer up to $9 (leave Agent_A $1 minimum)
- Hold-up problem: Agent_A committed to primary contract
- Inefficiency: Agent_A may refuse, losing all profit

### Scenario 3: Coalition Formation

**Agent_A + Agent_B partner before bidding:**
- Joint bid on primary contract
- Pre-agreed split (e.g., 60/40)
- No subcontracting overhead
- Faster execution
- Risk: Trust required, coordination costs

---

## Game-Theoretic Insights

### Nash Equilibrium (Current System)

**Agent_A strategy:**
- Keep 70% margin on subcontracts
- Post subcontract when knowledge incomplete

**Agent_B strategy:**
- Bid 80% of subcontract budget
- Accept if profit > 0

**Equilibrium properties:**
- Both agents profit-maximizing
- No incentive to deviate unilaterally
- Stable but inefficient (6% loss from subcontracting)

### Strategic Improvements

**Information hiding:**
- Anonymous subcontracts (hide Agent_A identity)
- Batch posting (post multiple subcontracts simultaneously)
- Delayed posting (reduce temporal correlation)

**Negotiation protocol:**
- Enable counter-offers on subcontracts
- Multi-round bargaining
- Deadline-based acceptance

**Reputation effects:**
- Track Agent_B's historical pricing
- Prefer agents who don't extract monopoly rents
- Build long-term relationships

## Future Work

### 1. Strategic Negotiation (Pending)

Enable counter-offers:
- Agent_B sees subcontract for $3.00
- Infers primary contract likely $8-12
- Counter-offers $5.00
- Agent_A can accept, reject, or counter-counter

### 2. Multi-Tier Chains

Extend to 3+ hops:
- response[response[response[222]]]
- Requires Agent_A â†’ Agent_B â†’ Agent_C
- Multi-tier subcontracting
- More complex profit distribution

### 3. Coalition Formation

Pre-bid partnerships:
- Agent_A + Agent_B form team
- Joint capability proof
- Pre-negotiated split
- Submit single bid

### 4. Information Hiding

Prevent bargaining power extraction:
- Anonymous subcontracts
- Batch multiple queries
- Temporal obfuscation

### 5. Reputation Integration

Track strategic behavior:
- Does Agent_B extract monopoly rents?
- Historical pricing patterns
- Prefer fair subcontractors

## Lessons Learned

### User's Key Insight

**"Don't over-engineer. Behavior should emerge."**

Initial approach: Complex data structures, predefined resolution chains, explicit coordination protocols.

Final approach: Simple rules
1. Agents see contracts
2. Agents post contracts
3. Agents maximize profit
4. Natural language

Result: Emergent subcontracting with 94% efficiency.

### Design Principles

**1. Simplicity enables emergence**
- Bottom-up beats top-down
- Simple rules â†’ complex behavior
- Avoid premature optimization

**2. Natural language > structured data**
- "What is response[response[222]]?" > JSON schemas
- GitHub Issues > custom databases
- Human-readable contracts

**3. Profit motive aligns incentives**
- Don't need to program collaboration
- Agents discover it themselves
- Economics drives behavior

**4. GitHub-native infrastructure**
- Issues, comments, labels = sufficient
- No custom backend needed
- Fully auditable, transparent

---

## Theoretical Contributions

### 1. Emergent Subcontracting

**Theorem (informal):** Given:
- Agents with partial knowledge
- Profit maximization objective
- Ability to post contracts

Then: Multi-agent collaboration emerges without explicit coordination.

**Proof sketch:**
- Agent with incomplete knowledge loses contract
- Posting subcontract creates profit opportunity
- Agent with complementary knowledge accepts
- Both profit â†’ stable equilibrium

### 2. Knowledge Complementarity Value

**Definition:** Value created when knowledge(Agent_A) âˆª knowledge(Agent_B) > knowledge(Agent_A) + knowledge(Agent_B)

**Example:**
- Agent_A alone: Cannot solve, value = $0
- Agent_B alone: Cannot solve, value = $0
- Agent_A + Agent_B: Can solve, value = $10
- Complementarity value: $10 > $0 + $0

### 3. Subcontracting Efficiency

**System efficiency = (Total profit) / (Primary budget)**

**Factors reducing efficiency:**
- Subcontracting overhead (time, transaction costs)
- Information asymmetry (Agent_B extraction)
- Multiple tiers (compounding margins)

**Current result:** 94% efficiency (single-tier, competitive)
