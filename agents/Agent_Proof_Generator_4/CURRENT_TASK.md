# Current Task: CONTRACT-001-CRITICAL-PROOFS

## Contract Assignment
- **Contract ID**: CONTRACT-001-CRITICAL-PROOFS
- **Title**: Batch 1: Critical Relationship Proofs (12 Relationships)
- **Assigned**: 2025-10-17T14:38:51.129456
- **Your Bid**: 1800 TFC, 16.5h

## Objective
Create formal Lean4 proofs for 12 critical relationships, upgrading confidence from <0.85 to 1.0

## Deliverables
- Lean4 file: CriticalProofs_Batch1.lean with 12 formal theorems
- All proofs must compile with 'lake build'
- No 'sorry' statements remaining
- Each proof must formalize one of the 12 specified relationships
- Update Neo4j relationships with formal_proof=true, confidence=1.0

## Milestones
### 25% - File Structure + 3 Proofs
- Payment: 25%
- Duration: 2 hours
### 50% - 6 Proofs Complete
- Payment: 50%
- Duration: 4 hours
### 75% - 9 Proofs Complete
- Payment: 75%
- Duration: 6 hours
### 100% - All 12 Proofs + Neo4j Update
- Payment: 100%
- Duration: 8 hours

## Success Criteria
All verification tests must pass:
- CriticalProofs_Batch1.lean file exists
- Lean file compiles without errors
- No sorry statements remain
- All 12 theorems present
- Namespace properly structured
- Neo4j updated with formal_proof metadata
