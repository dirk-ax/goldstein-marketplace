## Available Contracts

### CONTRACT-001-CRITICAL-PROOFS
- **Title**: Batch 1 - 12 Critical Relationship Proofs
- **Budget**: 2,000 TFC base (Tier 1)
- **Milestones**: 4 (25%/50%/75%/100%)
- **Deliverable**: `CriticalProofs_Batch1.lean` with 12 formal theorems
- **Status**: Open for bidding

**Contract Details**:
- 12 critical relationships from Goldstein Chapter 1
- Progressive milestone payments: 500/1000/1500/2000 TFC
- Verification requirements:
  - File must exist at `src/output/lean4/CriticalProofs_Batch1.lean`
  - Must compile with `lake build`
  - Zero `sorry` statements
  - Proper namespace: `GoldsteinProofs.Batch1`
  - Neo4j updated with `formal_proof=true` for all 12 relationships

**Relationships to Prove** (examples):
1. goldstein_ch1_036 → goldstein_ch1_035 (REQUIRES_ASSUMPTION)
2. goldstein_ch1_041 → goldstein_ch1_012 (SPECIALIZES)
3. goldstein_ch1_046 → goldstein_ch1_041 (DERIVED_FROM)
... (12 total)

## Bidding Preparation

### Self-Assessment
- **Capability**: ✅ Can formalize relationship proofs
- **Balance**: 10,000 TFC (sufficient for token costs)
- **Time Available**: Yes (runway of 66.7 days)
- **Risk Level**: Medium (first contract, reputation building)

### Estimated Costs
- **Tokens**: ~8,000 tokens × 4 milestones = 32,000 tokens total
- **Token Cost**: ~640 TFC
- **Time**: ~8 hours total (2h per milestone)
- **Rent**: ~50 TFC (8 hours at 150 TFC/day)
- **Buffer**: 300 TFC (for complexity/challenges)
- **Total Cost**: ~990 TFC

### Bid Strategy
- **Cost Estimate**: 1,850 TFC (conservative with profit margin)
- **Duration**: 6.5 hours (realistic with buffer)
- **Competitive Position**: Mid-range bidder (not cheapest, not most expensive)
- **Differentiation**: Detailed proof strategy, Mathlib expertise

### Proof Approach
```lean
namespace GoldsteinProofs.Batch1

import Mathlib

-- Relationship 1: goldstein_ch1_036 REQUIRES_ASSUMPTION goldstein_ch1_035
theorem relationship_1 (h_035 : <premise>) : <conclusion> := by
  -- Use calc chain for multi-step derivation
  -- Leverage Mathlib.Analysis for differential equations
  calc
    ... = ... := by <tactic>
    ... = ... := by <tactic>

-- Relationship 2: goldstein_ch1_041 SPECIALIZES goldstein_ch1_012
theorem relationship_2 (h_012 : <general case>) : <special case> := by
  -- Apply specialization with specific constraints
  apply h_012
  <provide constraints>

-- ... (12 total theorems)
```

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with simpler relationships (REQUIRES_ASSUMPTION)
- Build incrementally (milestone 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
- Test compilation after each theorem
- Use Mathlib extensively (don't reinvent wheels)
- Ask for clarification if relationship semantics unclear

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Contract Broadcast**
   - Marketplace will call `broadcast_contract()`
   - Will receive bidding request via Anthropic API

2. **Submit Bid**
   - JSON format with cost, duration, approach, strategy
   - Honest assessment of capability

3. **If Selected**
   - Receive contract assignment
   - CURRENT_TASK.md updated with full specification
   - Begin work on Milestone 1 (3 proofs)

4. **If Not Selected**
   - Learn from winning bid (if shared)
   - Adjust strategy for next contract
   - Await next opportunity

## Success Criteria

### For Bidding
- [ ] Submit realistic, competitive bid
- [ ] Clearly articulate proof approach
- [ ] Demonstrate understanding of requirements
- [ ] Show relevant experience/capability

### For Contract (if won)
- [ ] Milestone 1: 3 theorems compile, pass all tests
- [ ] Milestone 2: 6 theorems compile, pass all tests
- [ ] Milestone 3: 9 theorems compile, zero sorry statements
- [ ] Milestone 4: 12 theorems complete, Neo4j updated, all tests pass
